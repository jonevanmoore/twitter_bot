        '“Morality binds and blinds. It binds us into ideological teams that fight each other as though the fate of the world depended on our side winning each battle. It blinds us to the fact that each team is composed of good people who have something important to say.” - @JonHaidt',
        '“If you think that moral reasoning is something we do to figure out the truth, you’ll be constantly frustrated by how foolish, biased, and illogical people become when they disagree with you.” - @JonHaidt',
        '“Anyone who values truth should stop worshipping reason.” - @JonHaidt',
